# `x` directory

This directory contains code that is compatible with KNE but is outside of the
main tree. Code is separated here to indicate that it is less thoroughly tested
than the rest of the code in the repository. There is no SLO for `x` code. Code
under `x` may contain backwards incompatible changes (although this will try to
be avoided).

We will try to maintain this tree and continue to contribute to and enhance it.
However this will largely be "best effort" and held to a lesser standard than
the main tree.

This is similar to the concept of core Golang X-repositories (with even looser
requirements). See https://go.dev/wiki/X-Repositories for more info.
